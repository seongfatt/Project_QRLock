# QRLOCK Access Control System (Simulator Mode)

QRLOCK is a simulated QR code-based access control system designed for environments where physical GPIO hardware is unavailable. It mimics the behavior of a smart lock system using QR codes and a door button, with support for one-time passcodes (OTP) and administrative control.

## üîß Features

- ‚úÖ Simulated GPIO interface for lock and button control
- üì¶ SQLite database for storing QR codes and OTP flags
- üîê QR code validation with optional OTP mode
- üßë‚Äçüíº Admin menu for managing QR codes and system settings
- üõ†Ô∏è Button-triggered exit mechanism
- üìã Viewable QR code database with timestamps

---

## üß† How It Works

1. **Startup**:
   - Initializes the SQLite database (`qr_access_demo.db`)
   - Sets up simulated GPIO pins for lock and exit button

2. **QR Code Scanning**:
   - Users input QR codes via terminal
   - Valid QR codes unlock the simulated lock for 5 seconds
   - OTP codes are deleted after use

3. **Exit Button**:
   - Simulated button press triggers lock release

4. **Admin Access**:
   - Scanning the special QR code `ADMIN123` opens the admin menu
   - Admins can add/delete/reset QR codes, toggle OTP mode, and view the database

## üõ†Ô∏è Admin Menu Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1      | Save a single QR code (with optional OTP flag) |
| 2      | Continuous QR code scan (until 'STOP') |
| 3      | Delete a specific QR code |
| 4      | Reset all QR codes |
| 5      | Toggle OTP mode on/off |
| 6      | View all QR codes in the database |
| 7      | Exit admin menu |

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE qr_codes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    qr_code TEXT UNIQUE,
    date_added TEXT,
    otp INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

- `qr_code`: Unique identifier scanned by users
- `date_added`: Timestamp of QR code entry
- `otp`: Flag indicating if the code is one-time use (1) or reusable (0)

---

## üö™ Lock Simulation

- Lock is controlled via `LOCK_PIN` (simulated GPIO pin 16)
- Unlocks for 5 seconds upon valid QR scan or button press
- Exit button is simulated via `BUTTON_PIN` (GPIO pin 15)

## üß™ Simulator Mode

This implementation uses `MockGPIO` to simulate Raspberry Pi GPIO behavior in a terminal environment. All GPIO actions are printed to the console for visibility.

---

## üèÅ Getting Started

1. Run the script in a Python environment
2. Wait for QR code input or button press
3. Use `Example123` to access admin controls
4. Manage QR codes and test lock behavior

---

## üìå Notes

- OTP codes are automatically deleted after successful use
- Admin QR code is hardcoded as `example123`
- All interactions are simulated via terminal prompts

---

## üìÇ File Overview

- `qr_access_demo.db`: SQLite database file
- `MockGPIO`: Simulated GPIO class
- `admin_menu()`: Admin interface for QR code management
- `unlock_lock()`: Simulates unlocking mechanism
- `is_valid_qr_code()`: Validates QR codes with optional OTP logic

---

## üßπ Cleanup

On exit (e.g., `Ctrl+C`), the system performs GPIO cleanup to simulate proper shutdown.
